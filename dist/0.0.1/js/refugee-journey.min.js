You know once you get there you’ll be able to get on a train and head north into Europe. At the major Greek port, Patras, you manage to pile your children onto the back of a lorry travelling on a ferry to Bari, Italy, and hide.</p><p>What you didnt’ know is that there is a readmissions agreement between Italy and Greece, designed to stop illegal immigration. It shouldn’t apply to people in need of international protection, but the men who find you in the lorry are not interested in your story.

Although you pass through Germany, which has a high acceptance rate for Syrian asylum seekers, your family have promised you support and help if you can reach them. When you finally arrive in Stockholm you claim asylum.</p>",refugee_life_in_italy:'<p>When you find border officials in Bari you want to claim asylum. They give you a cash payment of €200 and train tickets to Rome where you claim asylum and are given a temporary place to stay.</p><p>Eventually you are given refugee status, but there is no welfare support or housing, as there would have been in Sweden or the UK. You rely on church groups for food and Italian lessons.</p><p>In 2011 the Guardian found hundreds of recognised refugees, including children, sleeping in the street in Rome.</p><p>Unfortunately you can’t move on now. Under the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/07/dublin-regulation-european-asylum-seekers">‘Dublin’ system, refugees can only seek asylum in the first EU country they enter</a>.

In the UK, Sweden and Germany, asylum seekers are given housing while their claim is processed, and support once they are granted refugee status. This is not always the case in Greece, Italy or the eastern European countries like Bulgaria. Experts warn that as long as these differences exist, people will continue to make dangerous journeys overland to reach a country that promises safety and support.</p>",resettlement:'<p>The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/51e7ecc56.html">UNHCR has called for 30,000 of the most vulnerable Syrian refugees to be resettled in western countries</a>.

They take you to a refugee camp and register you - you are now one of at least 600,000 registered Syrian refugees in Turkey. Turkey has an opt out from the Geneva Convention and does not grant asylum to people from outside the European Union. So although you are provided basic support in the camp, you’ll never have the right to work here legally (although many refugees work illegally).
