Friends in the Syrian community in Istanbul have given you the contact details of a church that helps refugee families so you head there. Now you are here you have two choices.</p>",italy_to_sweden:"<p> Even though you don’t have documents allowing you to travel legally within the EU, you follow a path many others have taken and try to travel by boat via the Adriatic to Italy, from there you will be able to get a train onwards into Europe.

Un (need to do a bit more research here on what happens on this journey) Last year, some European countries threatened Greece with removal from the Schengen agreement if they did not tighten their borders. Greece is under enormous pressure to stop migrants crossing it’s borders, as is Turkey. Illegal push backs have been reported on this Adriatic route. You now have two choices. 1 Stay in Patras and try again. (Go to scene 14) 2 You can’t face any more travelling so decide to stay in Athens for now. (Go to scene 10)</p>",life_in_athens:"<p>You have connections within the refugee community in Athens, and there are Church groups who provide food for families with children. But one day when you are waiting outside the church at lunchtime the police arrive and take you and your children to a detention centre. Your son, who is only 14, is taken away and put into the male section of the camp, with adult men. You and your daughter have to share a room with several other women, there is very little fresh water and XXX Thousands of asylum seekers are detained, for up to 18 months for administrative purposes only, in what have been described as ’appalling conditions.,’ by the EU (Home Affairs Commissioner). Each year thousands of migrants are arrested and held in detention, in conditions the EU Home Affairs Commissioner as ’appalling’. The far right are on the rise. (poss video/ audio/ story? - past stories / videos? video from Calais?) Greece has focused on reinforcing its external borders and started a policy which relies too heavily on detention. Despite the Greek authorities’ determination to improve the asylum system and detention conditions, which in many instances remain deplorable, much still needs to be done. Similarly the challenges arising from the large flow of Syrianrefugees into Turkey and now increasingly into Greece and other European countries is an issue where Europe needs to show more solidarity. The difficult economic context in Greece is contributing to rising social tension as well as increasing racism and xenophobia. This has to be tackled. Most migrants and asylum seekers do not want to stay in Greece and plan to continue their journey further into Europe. Many of them are however stuck in Greece, due to border checks and arrests when trying to exit Greece, [5] the current Dublin Regulation, and the fact that many irregular migrants cannot be returned to their country of origin.</p>",overland_to_sweeden:"<p>Many asylum seekers try to leave Italy without being detected. There have been widely reported problems for refugees there, even once people are recognised as refugees under international law, there is often a lack of any kind of support. In 2011 the Guardian visited Rome, where hundreds of refugees, including children were sleeping in the street. GO TO VIDEO INSERT> Africans/ Afghans Even though all migrants detected at an international border should have their fingerprints stored on the Eurodac system, to stop them claiming asylum in more than one country, there have been reports that Italian border officials do not take fingerprints of all migrants, but release them to travel onwards into Europe. You have enough money left to pay for trains that take you out of Italy, north towards Sweden, changing to a ferry at Rostock (give more details of routes). Although you pass through Germany, which has a high acceptance rate for Syrian asylum seekers, your family have promised you support and help if you can reach them. When you finally arrive in Stockholm you claim asylum.</p>",refugee_life_in_italy:"<p>You tell the border officials in Bari that you want to claim asylum. They give you a cash payment of 200 euros and train tickets to Rome. Once you are in Rome you claim asylum. Because you have children you are given a place in a reception centre, although friends you have made on your journey are not so lucky. Not all asylum seekers are given housing in Italy, many end up sleeping on the street.There have been widely reported criticisms of the Italian asylum system and the lack of support for refugees.Asylum seekers say that the huge difference in the way refugees are treated across Europe leaves them with the choice of life on the streets in Greece or Italy, or a hazardous illegal journey towards northern European countries like Sweden, the UK or Germany.VIDEO INSERT – ROME/ CALAIS etc?GO TO VIDEO INSERT> Africans/ Afghans. Eventually you are given refugee status, but there is no welfare support and you can’t speak Italian so it’s impossible to find work. You are allowed to stay in your hostel but you don’t have any money left so you have to rely on church groups for food and basic Italian lessons. Unfortunately you can’t move on now. You have been fingerprinted in Rome and your prints are stored on the Eurodac system. Under the ‘Dublin’ system, asylum seekers are only allowed to make a claim in the first EU country they enter. But the differences in support on offer around the EU means that people continue to try and breach this system. In the two years to the end of October 2013, Sweden has received 20,490 new Syrian asylum applications and Germany received 16,100 such applications. Less than 1,000 people have claimed asylum in each of Greece, Italy and Cyprus. All you can do is struggle on, trying to learn Italian and relying on the support of the churches and fellow refugees.</p>",refugee_life_in_sweden:"<p>You are given a place to stay in a hostel for families, put in touch with Syrian support groups and given access to a basic benefit that will help you survive until your asylum claim is heard. You explain to the officials why you left Syria and within a month you are told you have permanent residence. You are given social housing and free Swedish lessons and told that once you speak reasonable Swedish you will be given help finding a job. VIDEO INSERT – back to Somalia guy who was resettled, talking about life in Sweden? Although there is now a Common EU Asylum System, which came into operation in summer 2014, nobody denies that the way refugees are treated varies wildly from country to country. In the UK, Sweden and Germany, asylum seekers are given housing while their claim is processed, and support once they are granted refugee status. This is not always the case in Greece, Italy or the eastern European countries. Experts and EU politicians continually warn that as long as these differences exist, people will continue to make dangerous journeys overland to reach a country that promises safety and support.

Excluding Germany, the remaining 27 EU members states have offered to take only 2,340 refugees directly from Syria.

The UNHCR and other aid organisations have warned of the pressure this is putting on Turkey and also on neighbouring Jordan and Lebanon.You start to feel at home in the camp eventually.
