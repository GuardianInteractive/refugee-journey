You know many people who have left Syria, most to neighbouring countries where they are in refugee camps and some who have reached northern European countries and been given refugee protection.</p><p>You have some money you could use for your journey and so now your choices begin.</p>',"asylum_1" : '<p>You do your research and find out Sweden announced in September 2013 that it would give permanent residence to all Syrian refugees.</p><p>Sweden has received about 14,700 asylum applications from Syrians since early 2012. Among them are members of your family who you speak to regularly on the phone. They tell you that they are being given support in building a new life there and that they would help if you came, wiring money along the way to make your savings go further.</p><p>Unfortunately there is a catch. In order to apply for asylum in Sweden you need to actually get there first. This is true of most northern European countries.</p><p>For example, The UK and France have high recognition rates for Syrians who apply for asylum within their borders but they don\'t take applications at their foreign embassies.</p><p>There is a relatively small resettlement programme in place, which moves refugees directly from camps to European countries but you would first have to be in a refugee camp to find out if you were eligible for this.( XXX Put stat in about asylum applications from Syrians across whole of Europe. )</p>',"asylum_2" : '<p>There is bad news. You can’t fly to Sweden because you don’t have a visa and no new visas are being granted to anyone in Syria. (CHECK) A small number of family reunification visas are being granted to close family members such as children and spouses but this doesn’t apply to you. Last year in Europe only X family reunification visas were issued. (CHECK) Even if your husband was in Sweden or the UK you would not be guaranteed a visa to join him.</p><p>If you want to leave Syria you have to travel overland and if you hope to reach a northern European country you will have to do so illegally. There are now almost no legal routes to reach countries like Italy, Sweden or the UK, even though it is legal to claim asylum once you arrive.</p><p>It is not just Syrians who face this catch-22 situation. The number of visas needed for people leaving conflict-ridden countries has massively increased over the past decade.</p><p>XXX AUDIO INSERT - (MOHAMED – case study, have audio – he had a visa from previous travels – flew into UK with his family)Mohamed travelled directly to the UK with his family using a visa he received before war broke out. When he reached Heathrow airport he claimed asylum at the immigration desk.</p>',"bulgaria" : '<p>You pay a people smuggler to lead you with a group of people through dense forests along the border between Turkey and Bulgaria. When you reach the Bulgarian border, armed men appear, line you all up and ask for ID. They then force your group into the back of their van and drive back towards (Turkish town? need to check) where they leave you. All the children are crying as you walk back towards XX (town?). Eventually you make it back to Istanbul.</p><p>Even though such \'push backs\' are illegal, there have been reports of Syrians being turned away at the Bulgarian border, or driven straight back to Turkey, with no access to a fair asylum procedure. VIDEO INSERT – Story from Bulgaria / Turkey of Syrians talking about illegal push backs.</p>',"bulgaria_again" : '<p>When you reach the border this time the guards take you to one of several camps that have been set up to house Syrian refugees.</p><p>You are told that the camp is called Harmanli. It is an open air detention centre and you are not allowed to leave, so there is no chance to move further into Europe or turn back and return to Turkey. The conditions are extremely bad, with little or no official presence, no reception process and very little food. Many thousands of migrants, not only Syrians, but Afghans, Bangladeshis and even some Africans have started to take what was previously a barely used route via Turkey into Bulgaria and therefore the EU. According toAmnesty International, an estimated 5,000 refugees from Syria arrived between January and November 2013. </p><p>In a recent visit, the Guardian found a complete lack of official support for newly arrived refugees and very poor conditions inside. One heavily pregnant woman, separated from her husband in Turkey, was refused permission to leave the camp to give birth.</p><h2>A Harmanli story</h2><video id="video" controls="" preload="none" poster="vlcsnap-2013-12-20-16h57m47s41.png"><source id="mp4" src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/mp4/768/2013/12/20/BulgariaCampConditions_h264i.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source id="webm" src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/WebM/768/2013/12/20/BulgariaCampConditions.webm" type="video/webm"><source id="ogv" src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/oggv/768/2013/12/20/BulgariaCampConditions_h264i.ogv" type="video/ogg"><p>Your user agent does not support the HTML5 Video element.</p></video><p>There is no way forward or back for you. The UNHCR is pushing for improved conditions in Bulgaria and the (Bulgarian?) government has promised to provide more support but for now, you are stuck.</p>',"greek_asylum_system" : '<p>You join a queue of hundreds waiting outside the Aliens Police Directorate in Athens to register as an asylum seeker. Unfortunately, the Greek asylum system has been in a state of chaos for several years and your claim for asylum, like most, is refused. Practically no Syrians have been given asylum in Greece since the war began. In 2012, for instance, none were accepted (how many entrants? What are 2013 figures). There is little support for those few who manage to make a claim.</p><p>The Greek government has been criticised for failing to provide adequate reception and support for vulnerable migrants and for the \'deplorable\' conditions faced by Syrians in particular. (link to Amnesty report).(INSERT VIDEO HERE - situation in Greece).</p><p>You now have several choices.</p>',"greek_border" : '<p>You decide that however dangerous the journey across the Greek border might be, it’s better than staying in a camp indefinitely. If you make it to northern Europe you should be able to work and move on with your life until it is safe to return to Syria. You leave the camp and take your children to Istanbul, which is full of migrants from across the Middle East and Asia, as well as people smugglers who offer to take you into Greece for a price.</p><p>Unfortunately you do not make it across the Greek border. For the past decade this has been the main route to cross irregularly into the EU, with over 90 % of migrants doing so in 2012. Since 2010 there has been a huge increase in EU support for border protection in the Evros region where most migrants cross. (stat here about numbers dropping). In 2012, 8,000 Syrians were arrested on the Greek border.</p><p> You are stopped by border guards who are abusive to you and your children. They take you back to Turkey without assessing whether you are in need of refugee protection even though this is a breach of international law.</p><h2>Illegal pushback</h2><video id="video" controls="" preload="none" poster="vlcsnap-2013-12-20-16h54m27s251.png"><source id="mp4" src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/mp4/768/2013/12/20/GreeceBorderPushback_h264i.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source id="webm" src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/WebM/768/2013/12/20/GreeceBorderPushback.webm" type="video/webm"><source id="ogv" src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/oggv/768/2013/12/20/GreeceBorderPushback_h264i.ogv" type="video/ogg"><p>Your user agent does not support the HTML5 Video element.</p></video><p>A <a href="http://ecre.org/component/content/article/70-weekly-bulletin-articles/486-pro-asyl-accuses-greece-of-systematically-pushing-back-refugees-at-the-greek-turkish-border.html">2013 report</a> detailed evidence of an illegal \'push back\' policy on both the land and sea border between Turkey and Greece. You make your way back to Istanbul where you now have two choices.</p>',"into_greece" : '<p>This time, after paying the smugglers again, you are one of the dwindling number who do make it over the Evros border and into Greece. (do we have a story to illustrate this???). After crossing the border you travel to Athens (how?). Friends in the Syrian community in Istanbul have given you the contact details of a church that helps refugee families so you head there. Now you are here you have two choices.</p>',"italy_to_sweden" : '<p> Even though you don’t have documents allowing you to travel legally within the EU, you follow a path many others have taken and try to travel by boat via the Adriatic to Italy, from there you will be able to get a train onwards into Europe. You go to the main Greek port, Patras and arrive in Bari in Italy. Un (need to do a bit more research here on what happens on this journey).</p><p>You now have two choices. 1 Stay in Patras and try again. (Go to scene 14) 2 You can’t face any more travelling so decide to stay in Athens for now. (Go to scene 10) </p><p>Some European countries (which? France?) threatened Greece (in 2012?) with removal from the Schengen agreement if it didn\'t tighten its borders. Greece is under enormous pressure to stop migrants crossing its borders, as is Turkey. Illegal \'push backs\' have been reported on this Adriatic route.</p>',"life_in_athens" : '<p>You have connections within the refugee community in Athens and there are church groups who provide food for families with children. But one day when you are waiting outside the church at lunchtime the police arrive and take you and your children to a detention centre. Your son, who is only 14, is taken away and put into the male section of the camp with adult men. You and your daughter have to share a room with several other women, there is very little fresh water and XXX?</p><p>Thousands of asylum seekers are detained in Greece (?) each year and held in what have been described as \'appalling conditions\' by the EU home affairs commissioner (name? link?). These periods of detention can last for up to 18 months for administrative purposes only.</p><p>Greece has focused on reinforcing its external borders and started a policy which relies heavily on detention. Despite the Greek authorities’ determination to improve often deplorable detention conditions and the asylum system generally, much remains to be done. The difficult economic context in Greece is contributing to rising social tension as well as increasing racism and xenophobia with far right groups on the rise.</p><p>The challenges arising from the large flow of Syrian refugees into Turkey and now increasingly into Greece and other European countries is an issue where Europe needs to show more solidarity. Most migrants and asylum seekers do not want to stay in Greece and plan to continue their journey further into Europe. Many of them are however stuck in Greece, due to border checks and arrests when trying to exit Greece, the current Dublin Regulation (link?), and the fact that many irregular migrants cannot be returned to their country of origin.</p>',"overland_to_sweeden" : '<p>Many asylum seekers try to leave Italy without being detected. There have been widely reported problems for refugees there and there is often a lack of support. In 2011 the Guardian visited Rome, where hundreds of refugees, including children, were sleeping in the street. GO TO VIDEO INSERT> Africans/ Afghans</p><p>Even though all migrants detected at an international border should have their fingerprints stored on the Eurodac system to stop them claiming asylum in more than one country, there have been reports (link?) that Italian border officials do not fingerprint all migrants and release them to travel onwards into Europe.</p><p>You have enough money left to pay for trains that take you out of Italy, north towards Sweden, changing to a ferry at Rostock (give more details of routes). Although you pass through Germany, which has a high acceptance rate for Syrian asylum seekers, your family have promised you support and help if you can reach them. When you finally arrive in Stockholm you claim asylum.</p>',"refugee_life_in_italy" : '<p>You tell the border officials in Bari that you want to claim asylum. They give you a cash payment of 200 euros and train tickets to Rome. Once you are in Rome you claim asylum. Because you have children you are given a place in a reception centre, although friends you have made on your journey are not so lucky.</p><p>Not all asylum seekers are given housing in Italy and many end up sleeping on the street. There have been widely reported (where? link?) criticisms of the Italian asylum system and the lack of support for refugees. Asylum seekers say that the huge difference in the way refugees are treated across Europe leaves them with the choice of life on the streets in Greece or Italy, or a hazardous illegal journey towards northern European countries like Sweden, the UK or Germany.VIDEO INSERT – ROME/ CALAIS etc?GO TO VIDEO INSERT> Africans/ Afghans.</p><p>Eventually you are given refugee status, but there is no welfare support and you can’t speak Italian so it’s impossible to find work. You are allowed to stay in your hostel but you don’t have any money left so you have to rely on church groups for food and basic Italian lessons. Unfortunately, you can’t leave Italy because you were fingerprinted in Rome and your prints are now stored on the Eurodac system. All you can do is struggle on, trying to learn Italian and relying on the support of the churches and fellow refugees.</p><p>Under the \'Dublin\' system, asylum seekers are only allowed to make a claim in the first EU country they enter. But the differences in support on offer around the EU means that people continue to try and breach this system. In the two years to the end of October 2013, Sweden received 20,490 new Syrian asylum applications and Germany received 16,100. Less than 1,000 people have claimed asylum in each of Greece, Italy and Cyprus. </p>',"refugee_life_in_sweden" : '<p>You are given a place to stay in a hostel for families, put in touch with Syrian support groups and given access to a basic benefit that will help you survive until your asylum claim is heard. You explain to the officials why you left Syria and within a month are told you have permanent residence. You are given social housing and free Swedish lessons and told that once you speak reasonable Swedish you will be given help finding a job.</p>VIDEO INSERT – back to Somalia guy who was resettled, talking about life in Sweden?<p>Although there is now a common EU asylum system, which came into operation in summer 2014 (date check?), the way refugees are treated still varies wildly from country to country. In the UK, Sweden and Germany, asylum seekers are given housing while their claim is processed, and support once they are granted refugee status. This is not always the case in Greece, Italy or the eastern European countries. Experts and EU politicians continually warn that as long as these differences exist, people will continue to make dangerous journeys overland to reach a country that promises safety and support. ((VIDEO LINK – CALAIS??? recent footage from protests in Calais? Calais film from a few years ago? Interview in Rome - with man explaining that system is different across the whole of Europe?)</p>',"resettlement" : '<p>The UNHCR has called for 30,000 of the most vulnerable Syrian refugees to be directly resettled into western countries via a screening process that is taking place in camps across the region.</p><p>Unfortunately for you, the numbers being offered this chance are very low compared to the numbers fleeing Syria. Excluding Germany, the remaining 27 EU member states have offered to take only 2,340 refugees directly from Syria. Eighteen member states, including the UK and Italy, have refused to take part, drawing condemnation from leading refugee agencies. The response so far has been criticised as \'shameful\' by Amnesty International and \'feeble\' by UNHCR. The country that has offered the most places is Germany, which has said it will take 10,000 people directly from camps. </p><p>VIDEO INSERT - Somali man now settled in Sweden. ??</p><p> You are not considered vulnerable enough, as the few places are being offered to families with sick or disabled children or a parent who is struggling to cope with looking after children. You are in good health, as are your children, so you now have two choices.</p>',"stay_in_turkey" : '<p>You can’t work but you are not under attack so you have a sense of safety. The camp you are in is not a bad one and the Turkish government is doing what it can to provide an education for your children and they are able to go to school for a few hours a day.</p><p>You meet your neighbours and eventually start to feel at home in the camp. One of them has a Palestinian grandfather who knows people from his childhood who went to a refugee camp in Lebanon in 1948 and are still there. You wonder if your children will spend their entire lives in this camp. Your story is not over, but nor is it continuing. You stay in Turkey and hope that the peace talks succeed and you can return to Syria soon.</p><p>It is estimated (by who?) that there could be a million Syrians living in Turkey by the end of 2014. The UNHCR and other aid organisations have warned of the pressure this is putting on Turkey and also on neighbouring Jordan and Lebanon.</p>',"sweden_by_plane" : '<p>You are lucky this time. Your passports work and despite your nerves, you are allowed to board the plane.(stat here about how many asylum applications at Stockholm airport + at other EU countries)). As soon as your reach passport control at Stockholm airport you tell them your passport is fake and that you are here to claim asylum.</p>',"sweden_via_italy" : '<p>This time you make it into Italy (add more detail).You have two choices.</p>',"turkey" : '<p>You walk across the Turkish border and are met by UNHCR officials who take you to a refugee camp for registration. You are now among around 600,000 Syrians registered as refugees in Turkey</p><p>Turkey has an opt out from the Geneva conventions and does not grant asylum to people from outside the EU. So although you are given support in the camp you will never have the right to work in Turkey. Other refugees around you are talking about making the dangerous journey overland into the EU to join family members and try to get international protection, which carries with it the right to work and live a normal life.(video insert from Turkey?)<p>',"view_scene" : '<div class="scene"><h2 class="scene-title">{{ title }}</h2><div class="scene-inner"><div class="scene-copy">{{#insertImg}}<img src="{{ insertImg }}" class="insert-image" />{{/insertImg}}{{@index}}{{{ sceneContent }}}</div><div class="choices"><p class="choice-text">{{ choiceText }}</p><div class="button-container">{{#buttons}}<button class="choice-btn" data-destination="{{ destination }}">{{ text }}</button>{{/buttons}}</div></div></div></div>', "done": "true"};
