Your are a 28-year-old Sunni woman from Aleppo, and you have two children, a girl aged eight, and a 10-year-old boy. Your husband was killed in a mortar attack three months ago. The air strikes have continued - a recent bomb, you hear, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/23/syria-barrel-bombs-87-children-dead">killed 87 children</a> - and you now feel you must try to leave Syria.</p><p>Many of your friends and family have already fled, most to neighbouring countries where they are in refugee camps; few have travelled into Europe. Only 55,000 Syrian refugees - 2.4 per cent of the total number of people who have fled Syria - have claimed asylum in the EU. </p><p>You have some money you could use for your journey - you consider your options. </p>',"asylum_1" : '<p>You find out that in September 2013, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24635791">Sweden announced that it would give permanent residence to all Syrian refugees</a>. Two of your cousins have been given asylum in Stockholm and they tell you life is Sweden is better than a refugee camp. But there is a catch. In order to apply for asylum in Sweden you need to get there - you can’t apply from outside the country. This rule goes for the whole of Europe.</p><p>How do you get there? The safest and easiest way is to travel by plane. The alternative is to make your way overland to Turkey and then on from one of the large refugee camps there. You have heard that <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/523076919.html">the most vulnerable refugees are being airlifted from such camps directly into northern European countries</a>.</p>',"asylum_2" : '<p>Bad news. You can’t fly to Sweden because you don’t have a visa. As the war has worsened, European countries have increased visa restrictions for Syrians.</p><p>There are now almost no legal ways for Syrians to reach Europe, even though some countries are giving refugee status to nearly all Syrians who do make it there.</p><p>You have only one choice now. You have to travel overland if you want to leave Syria.</p>',"bulgaria" : '<p>You pay a smuggler and join group of people they lead through dense forests along the border of Turkey and Bulgaria.</p><p>In the thick of the woodland, you are stopped by Bulgarian border guards who pile your group into a van. The children are terrified and crying. The Bulgarian guards drive you back to Turkey. You aren’t sure if you reached Bulgarian territory or not, but you know you didn’t make it. Some of the families you travelled with were split up on the journey and have no idea how to find each other again.</p><p>These ‘push backs’ are illegal, but nonetheless, reports of Syrians being turned away at the Bulgarian border, or driven straight back to Turkey, with no access to a fair asylum procedure, are common.</p>',"bulgaria_again" : '<p>You are convinced you have to do whatever it takes to get your children into Europe. You will attempt the crossing to Bulgaria again. Again, when you reach the border you are picked up by guards but this time, they drive you into Bulgaria, bound for one of several camps that have been set up to house Syrian refugees. You are taken to Harmanli camp. It is an open air detention centre and you are not allowed to leave. You are unable to move further into Europe or turn back and return to Turkey. The conditions are terrible. There is next to no official presence, no reception process and very little food.</p><p>Many thousands of migrants, not only Syrians, but Afghans, Bangladeshis and even some Africans have started to take what was previously a barely used route into the EU, from Turkey and into Bulgaria. Amnesty International estimate that 5,000 refugees from Syria arrived between January and November 2013.</p><p>At Harmanli, the Guardian found a lack of official support for newly arrived refugees, many of them women and children, and dire conditions.</p><h2>A Harmanli story</h2><video id="video" controls="" preload="none" poster="vlcsnap-2013-12-20-16h57m47s41.png"><source id="mp4" src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/mp4/768/2013/12/20/BulgariaCampConditions_h264i.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source id="webm" src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/WebM/768/2013/12/20/BulgariaCampConditions.webm" type="video/webm"><source id="ogv" src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/oggv/768/2013/12/20/BulgariaCampConditions_h264i.ogv" type="video/ogg"><p>Your user agent does not support the HTML5 Video element.</p></video><p>There is no way forward or back for you. The UNHCR is pushing for improved conditions in Bulgaria and the government has promised to provide more support but for now, you are stuck.</p>',"greek_asylum_system" : '<p>You join a queue of hundreds of others waiting outside the Aliens Police Directorate in Athens to register as an asylum seeker. Unfortunately the Greek asylum system has been in a state of chaos for several years and your claim for asylum - like most others - is refused. <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/greece-the-end-of-the-road-for-refugees-asylum-seekers-and-migrants">In 2012 no Syrians were given asylum in Greece</a>. Abacklog of 30,000 unprocessed claims sits on the desk of Greek authorities. The Greek government has been repeatedly criticised by human rights organisations and the European courts for <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=4998&cat=press-release">failing to provide adequate reception and support for asylum seekers</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, you do now have a number of choices. You could return to Turkey and try to reach Europe via Bulgaria instead. You could try to make a life in Athens, blending into the underground Syrian community there. You could use your remaining savings to look for fake passports that would get you onto a plane to Stockholm. Or, if you don't want to risk using a false passport, you could push on toward Sweden overland, through the Balkans, and up across central Europe.</p>',"greek_border" : '<p>If you make it to northern Europe you have the chance of international protection, including the right to work and a normal life until it is safe to return to Syria. You set off with your children to Istanbul, where friends in the Syrian community put you in touch with a people smuggler who promises - for a price - to help you cross the Greek border.</p><p>Unfortunately you are stopped by border guards who are abusive towards you and take you back in Turkey without giving you the chance to ask for asylum in Greece.</p><p>A recent report detailed evidence of an <a href="http://ecre.org/component/content/article/70-weekly-bulletin-articles/486-pro-asyl-accuses-greece-of-systematically-pushing-back-refugees-at-the-greek-turkish-border.html">illegal ‘push back’ policy</a> on both the land and sea border between Turkey and Greece.</p><h2>Illegal pushback</h2><video id="video" controls="" preload="none" poster="vlcsnap-2013-12-20-16h54m27s251.png"><source id="mp4" src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/mp4/768/2013/12/20/GreeceBorderPushback_h264i.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source id="webm" src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/WebM/768/2013/12/20/GreeceBorderPushback.webm" type="video/webm"><source id="ogv" src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/oggv/768/2013/12/20/GreeceBorderPushback_h264i.ogv" type="video/ogg"><p>Your user agent does not support the HTML5 Video element.</p></video><p>With your funds depleted, you make your way back to Istanbul to begin again.</p>',"into_greece" : '<p>You pay the smugglers again and this time, make it across the border. The smugglers see you as far as Athens where you have the contact details of a church that helps refugee families. They give you a floor space to sleep on with your children and hot food each day.</p><p>Now you are here you have two choices.</p>',"italy_to_sweden" : '<p>Even though you don’t have documents allowing you to travel legally within the EU, you follow a well-worn path and attempt to travel by boat across the Adriatic to Italy. You know once you get there you’ll be able to get on a train and head north into Europe. At the major Greek port, Patras, you manage to pile your children onto the back of a lorry travelling on a ferry to Bari, Italy, and hide.</p><p>What you didnt’ know is that there is a readmissions agreement between Italy and Greece, designed to stop illegal immigration. It shouldn’t apply to people in need of international protection, but the men who find you in the lorry are not interested in your story. You tell them you are from Syria, <a href="http://oppenheimer.mcgill.ca/Medici-per-i-Diritti-Umani">but they put you back on the next boat to Patras</a>.</p><p>You now have two choices.</p>',"life_in_athens" : '<p>You have connections within the refugee community in Athens, and there are Church groups who provide food for families with children. But one day, when you are waiting outside the church at lunchtime, police arrive in force and take you and your children to a detention centre.</p><p>Thousands of migrants and asylum seekers are detained in Greece each year in what have been described as "<a href="ttp://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR25/014/2013/en/cd88850b-c123-417a-857e-b41d6a743cd3/eur250142013en.html">appalling conditions</a>," by the EU home affairs commissioner.</p><p>The economic problems Greece faces have fueled tensions between local and migrant communites - there is a surge in racist attacks targetting refugees.</p><p>Eventually you are released from the detention centre - the Greek government has a new policy of letting Syrians out of detention if they have identification. But you still have no legal right to live here. You join thousands of other refugees who live a precarious existence in Greece, relying on Churches and charities to survive.</p>',"overland_to_sweeden" : '<p>Many asylum seekers try to leave Italy without being detected. There have been widely reported problems for refugees there and there is often a lack of support. In 2011 the Guardian visited Rome, where hundreds of refugees, including children, were sleeping in the street. GO TO VIDEO INSERT> Africans/ Afghans</p><p>Even though all migrants detected at an international border should have their fingerprints stored on the Eurodac system to stop them claiming asylum in more than one country, there have been reports (link?) that Italian border officials do not fingerprint all migrants and release them to travel onwards into Europe.</p><p>You have enough money left to pay for trains that take you out of Italy, north towards Sweden, changing to a ferry at Rostock (give more details of routes). Although you pass through Germany, which has a high acceptance rate for Syrian asylum seekers, your family have promised you support and help if you can reach them. When you finally arrive in Stockholm you claim asylum.</p>',"refugee_life_in_italy" : '<p>When you find border officials in Bari you want to claim asylum. They give you a cash payment of €200 and train tickets to Rome where you claim asylum and are given a temporary place to stay.</p><p>Eventually you are given refugee status, but there is no welfare support or housing, as there would have been in Sweden or the UK. You rely on church groups for food and Italian lessons.</p><p>In 2011 the Guardian found hundreds of recognised refugees, including children, sleeping in the street in Rome.</p><p>Unfortunately you can’t move on now. Under the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/07/dublin-regulation-european-asylum-seekers">‘Dublin’ system, refugees can only seek asylum in the first EU country they enter</a>. You have been fingerprinted in Rome and your prints are available to border guards across Europe. </p><p>You have no option but to struggle on, try to learn Italian and rely on the support of the churches and other refugees.</p>',"refugee_life_in_sweden" : '<p>You are given a place to stay in a hostel for families, put in touch with Syrian support groups and given access to a basic benefit that will help you survive until your asylum claim is heard.</p><p>There is now a Common EU Asylum System - it came into operation in summer 2014 - but nobody denies that the way refugees are treated varies wildly from country to country. In the UK, Sweden and Germany, asylum seekers are given housing while their claim is processed, and support once they are granted refugee status. This is not always the case in Greece, Italy or the eastern European countries like Bulgaria. Experts warn that as long as these differences exist, people will continue to make dangerous journeys overland to reach a country that promises safety and support.</p>',"resettlement" : '<p>The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/51e7ecc56.html">UNHCR has called for 30,000 of the most vulnerable Syrian refugees to be resettled in western countries</a>. The 30,000 will be selected in a screening process taking place in camps across the region. The odds are slim - 98.5% of the Syrians who have fled the fighting will be left behind. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/fortress-europe-syrian-refugee-shame-exposed-2013-12-11">Eighteen EU countries, including the UK and Italy, have refused to take part</a> - a move that has been condemned by refugee groups. Only the most vulnerable groups, including orphaned children or women at risk of violence are being resettled. You don’t qualify for the scheme. </p>',"share_and_replay" : '<p>Some end copy goes here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><div class="share_links"><button class="share-twitter choice-btn">TWITTER</button><button class="share-facebook choice-btn">Facebook</button></div><p><button class="restart choice-btn">Restart</button></p>',"stay_in_turkey" : '<p>You can’t work, but you are not under attack. The Turkish government is doing what it can to provide an education for your children and they are able to go to school for a few hours a day.</p><p>You have the support and friendship of a large Syrian community, both in the camp and also in cities like Istanbul if you choose to move there and work under the radar. Officially there are now nearly 600,000 Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as refugees from Iran, Iraq and Turkey.</p><p>One of your friends in Turkey has a Palestinian grandfather who has been living in the same camp in Lebanon since 1948. You hope that Syria will be peaceful one day so you can go home - but live with a daily dread that you and your children will live the rest of your lives in limbo.</p>',"sweden_by_plane" : '<p>You’re in luck. Your passports work and despite your nerves you are allowed to board the plane.</p><p>As soon as your reach passport control at Stockholm airport you tell them that your passports are fake and you are here to claim asylum.</p>',"sweden_via_italy" : '<p>You and your children get on a boat at Patras, hidden in the back of a lorry. When you arrive in Italy, you manage to creep off the boat undetected.</p><p>You now have two choices.</a>',"turkey" : '<p>You walk across the Turkish border where you are met by UNHCR officials. They take you to a refugee camp and register you - you are now one of at least 600,000 registered Syrian refugees in Turkey. Turkey has an opt out from the Geneva Convention and does not grant asylum to people from outside the European Union. So although you are provided basic support in the camp, you’ll never have the right to work here legally (although many refugees work illegally). People in the camp are talking about making the dangerous journey overland into Europe, in the hope of getting international protection that would allow them to work and live a normal life.</p>',"view_scene" : '<div class="scene"><h2 class="scene-title">{{ title }}</h2><div class="scene-inner"><div class="scene-copy">{{#insertImg}}<img src="{{ insertImg }}" class="insert-image" />{{/insertImg}}{{@index}}{{{ sceneContent }}}</div><div class="choices"><p class="choice-text">{{ choiceText }}</p><div class="button-container">{{#buttons}}<button class="choice-btn" data-destination="{{ destination }}">{{ text }}</button>{{/buttons}}</div></div></div></div>', "done": "true"};
