Only 55,000 Syrian refugees - 2.4 per cent of the total number of people who have fled Syria - have claimed asylum in the EU. </p><p>You have some money you could use for your journey - you consider your options. </p>',"asylum_1" : '<p>You find out that in September 2013, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24635791">Sweden announced that it would give permanent residence to all Syrian refugees</a>. Two of your cousins have been given asylum in Stockholm and they tell you life is Sweden is better than a refugee camp. But there is a catch. In order to apply for asylum in Sweden you need to get there - you can’t apply from outside the country. This rule goes for the whole of Europe.</p><p>How do you get there? The safest and easiest way is to travel by plane. The alternative is to make your way overland to Turkey and then on from one of the large refugee camps there. You have heard that <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/523076919.html>"the most vulnerable refugees are being airlifted from such camps directly into northern European countries</a>.</p>',"asylum_2" : '<p>Bad news. You can’t fly to Sweden because you don’t have a visa. As the war has worsened, European countries have increased visa restrictions for Syrians.</p><p>There are now almost no legal ways for Syrians to reach Europe, even though some countries are giving refugee status to nearly all Syrians who do make it there.</p><p>You have only one choice now. You have to travel overland if you want to leave Syria.</p>',"bulgaria" : '<p>You pay a people smuggler to lead you with a group of people through dense forests along the border between Turkey and Bulgaria. When you reach the Bulgarian border, armed men appear, line you all up and ask for ID. They then force your group into the back of their van and drive back towards (Turkish town? need to check) where they leave you. All the children are crying as you walk back towards XX (town?). Eventually you make it back to Istanbul.</p><p>Even though such \'push backs\' are illegal, there have been reports of Syrians being turned away at the Bulgarian border, or driven straight back to Turkey, with no access to a fair asylum procedure.

It is an open air detention centre and you are not allowed to leave, so there is no chance to move further into Europe or turn back and return to Turkey. The conditions are extremely bad, with little or no official presence, no reception process and very little food. Many thousands of migrants, not only Syrians, but Afghans, Bangladeshis and even some Africans have started to take what was previously a barely used route via Turkey into Bulgaria and therefore the EU. According toAmnesty International, an estimated 5,000 refugees from Syria arrived between January and November 2013. </p><p>In a recent visit, the Guardian found a complete lack of official support for newly arrived refugees and very poor conditions inside. One heavily pregnant woman, separated from her husband in Turkey, was refused permission to leave the camp to give birth.</p><h2>A Harmanli story</h2><video id="video" controls="" preload="none" poster="vlcsnap-2013-12-20-16h57m47s41.png"><source id="mp4" src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/mp4/768/2013/12/20/BulgariaCampConditions_h264i.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source id="webm" src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/WebM/768/2013/12/20/BulgariaCampConditions.webm" type="video/webm"><source id="ogv" src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/oggv/768/2013/12/20/BulgariaCampConditions_h264i.ogv" type="video/ogg"><p>Your user agent does not support the HTML5 Video element.</p></video><p>There is no way forward or back for you.

Unfortunately the Greek asylum system has been in a state of chaos for several years and your claim for asylum - like most others - is refused. <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/greece-the-end-of-the-road-for-refugees-asylum-seekers-and-migrants">In 2012 no Syrians were given asylum in Greece</a>.

If you make it to northern Europe, you reason, you have the chance of international protection and with it the right to work and lead a relatively normal life until it’s safe to return to Syria. You leave the camp with your children and head to Istanbul, where friends in the Syrian community put you in touch with a people smuggler. He promises - for a price- to help you cross the Greek border.</p><p>It was a promise he was unable to keep. Your group is stopped by border guards on crossing into Greece.

They give you a floor space to sleep on with your children and hot food each day.</p><p>Now you are here you have two choices.</p>',"italy_to_sweden" : '<p> Even though you don’t have documents allowing you to travel legally within the EU, you follow a path many others have taken and try to travel by boat via the Adriatic to Italy, from there you will be able to get a train onwards into Europe. You go to the main Greek port, Patras and arrive in Bari in Italy. Un (need to do a bit more research here on what happens on this journey).</p><p>You now have two choices. 1 Stay in Patras and try again. (Go to scene 14) 2 You can’t face any more travelling so decide to stay in Athens for now. (Go to scene 10) </p><p>Some European countries (which? France?) threatened Greece (in 2012?) with removal from the Schengen agreement if it didn\'t tighten its borders. Greece is under enormous pressure to stop migrants crossing its borders, as is Turkey. Illegal \'push backs\' have been reported on this Adriatic route.</p>',"life_in_athens" : '<p>You have connections within the refugee community in Athens and there are church groups who provide food for families with children. But one day when you are waiting outside the church at lunchtime the police arrive and take you and your children to a detention centre. Your son, who is only 14, is taken away and put into the male section of the camp with adult men. You and your daughter have to share a room with several other women, there is very little fresh water and XXX?</p><p>Thousands of asylum seekers are detained in Greece (?) each year and held in what have been described as \'appalling conditions\' by the EU home affairs commissioner (name? link?). These periods of detention can last for up to 18 months for administrative purposes only.</p><p>Greece has focused on reinforcing its external borders and started a policy which relies heavily on detention. Despite the Greek authorities’ determination to improve often deplorable detention conditions and the asylum system generally, much remains to be done. The difficult economic context in Greece is contributing to rising social tension as well as increasing racism and xenophobia with far right groups on the rise.</p><p>The challenges arising from the large flow of Syrian refugees into Turkey and now increasingly into Greece and other European countries is an issue where Europe needs to show more solidarity. Most migrants and asylum seekers do not want to stay in Greece and plan to continue their journey further into Europe. Many of them are however stuck in Greece, due to border checks and arrests when trying to exit Greece, the current Dublin Regulation (link?), and the fact that many irregular migrants cannot be returned to their country of origin.</p>',"overland_to_sweeden" : '<p>Many asylum seekers try to leave Italy without being detected. There have been widely reported problems for refugees there and there is often a lack of support. In 2011 the Guardian visited Rome, where hundreds of refugees, including children, were sleeping in the street. GO TO VIDEO INSERT> Africans/ Afghans</p><p>Even though all migrants detected at an international border should have their fingerprints stored on the Eurodac system to stop them claiming asylum in more than one country, there have been reports (link?) that Italian border officials do not fingerprint all migrants and release them to travel onwards into Europe.</p><p>You have enough money left to pay for trains that take you out of Italy, north towards Sweden, changing to a ferry at Rostock (give more details of routes). Although you pass through Germany, which has a high acceptance rate for Syrian asylum seekers, your family have promised you support and help if you can reach them. When you finally arrive in Stockholm you claim asylum.</p>',"refugee_life_in_italy" : '<p>You tell the border officials in Bari that you want to claim asylum. They give you a cash payment of 200 euros and train tickets to Rome. Once you are in Rome you claim asylum. Because you have children you are given a place in a reception centre, although friends you have made on your journey are not so lucky.</p><p>Not all asylum seekers are given housing in Italy and many end up sleeping on the street. There have been widely reported (where? link?) criticisms of the Italian asylum system and the lack of support for refugees. Asylum seekers say that the huge difference in the way refugees are treated across Europe leaves them with the choice of life on the streets in Greece or Italy, or a hazardous illegal journey towards northern European countries like Sweden, the UK or Germany.VIDEO INSERT – ROME/ CALAIS etc?GO TO VIDEO INSERT> Africans/ Afghans.</p><p>Eventually you are given refugee status, but there is no welfare support and you can’t speak Italian so it’s impossible to find work. You are allowed to stay in your hostel but you don’t have any money left so you have to rely on church groups for food and basic Italian lessons. Unfortunately, you can’t leave Italy because you were fingerprinted in Rome and your prints are now stored on the Eurodac system. All you can do is struggle on, trying to learn Italian and relying on the support of the churches and fellow refugees.</p><p>Under the \'Dublin\' system, asylum seekers are only allowed to make a claim in the first EU country they enter. But the differences in support on offer around the EU means that people continue to try and breach this system. In the two years to the end of October 2013, Sweden received 20,490 new Syrian asylum applications and Germany received 16,100. Less than 1,000 people have claimed asylum in each of Greece, Italy and Cyprus. </p>',"refugee_life_in_sweden" : '<p>You are given a place to stay in a hostel for families, put in touch with Syrian support groups and given access to a basic benefit that will help you survive until your asylum claim is heard. You explain to the officials why you left Syria and within a month are told you have permanent residence. You are given social housing and free Swedish lessons and told that once you speak reasonable Swedish you will be given help finding a job.</p>VIDEO INSERT – back to Somalia guy who was resettled, talking about life in Sweden?<p>Although there is now a common EU asylum system, which came into operation in summer 2014 (date check?), the way refugees are treated still varies wildly from country to country. In the UK, Sweden and Germany, asylum seekers are given housing while their claim is processed, and support once they are granted refugee status. This is not always the case in Greece, Italy or the eastern European countries. Experts and EU politicians continually warn that as long as these differences exist, people will continue to make dangerous journeys overland to reach a country that promises safety and support.

Interview in Rome - with man explaining that system is different across the whole of Europe?)</p>',"resettlement" : '<p>The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/51e7ecc56.html">UNHCR has called for 30,000 of the most vulnerable Syrian refugees to be resettled in western countries</a>. The 30,000 will be selected in a screening process taking place in camps across the region. The odds are slim - 98.5% of the Syrians who have fled the fighting will be left behind. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/fortress-europe-syrian-refugee-shame-exposed-2013-12-11">Eighteen EU countries, including the UK and Italy, have refused to take part</a> - a move that has been condemned by refugee groups. Only the most vulnerable groups, including orphaned children or women at risk of violence are being resettled. You don’t qualify for the scheme. </p>',"stay_in_turkey" : '<p>You can’t work, but you are not under attack. The Turkish government is doing what it can to provide an education for your children and they are able to go to school for a few hours a day.</p><p>You have the support and friendship of a large Syrian community, both in the camp and also in cities like Istanbul if you choose to move there and work under the radar. Officially there are now nearly 600,000 Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as refugees from Iran, Iraq and Turkey.</p><p>One of your friends in Turkey has a Palestinian grandfather who has been living in the same camp in Lebanon since 1948. You hope that Syria will be peaceful one day so you can go home - but live with a daily dread that you and your children will live the rest of your lives in limbo.</p>',"sweden_by_plane" : '<p>You are lucky this time. Your passports work and despite your nerves, you are allowed to board the plane.(stat here about how many asylum applications at Stockholm airport + at other EU countries)). As soon as your reach passport control at Stockholm airport you tell them your passport is fake and that you are here to claim asylum.</p>',"sweden_via_italy" : '<p>This time you make it into Italy (add more detail).You have two choices.</p>',"turkey" : '<p>You walk across the Turkish border where you are met by UNHCR officials. They take you to a refugee camp and register you - you are now one of at least 600,000 registered Syrian refugees in Turkey. Turkey has an opt out from the Geneva Convention and does not grant asylum to people from outside the European Union. So although you are provided basic support in the camp, you’ll never have the right to work here legally (although many refugees work illegally). People in the camp are talking about making the dangerous journey overland into Europe, in the hope of getting international protection that would allow them to work and live a normal life.</p>', "done": "true"};
