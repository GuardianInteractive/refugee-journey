<p>You set off northwards on the long journey across Europe.</p><p>Luckily you avoided having your fingerprints taken by the authorities at Bari. In theory, all irregular migrants detected at an international border should have their fingerprints checked on the Eurodac system, to stop them claiming asylum in more than one country. But in any event there have been reports that Italian border officials do not take fingerprints of all migrants, but instead release them to travel onwards into Europe.</p><p>And from here, you face no new border checks before Sweden because you will remain within the Schengen area.</p><p>You have enough money left to pay for buses that take you out of Italy, into Austria, then the Czech Republic, through Germany and Denmark before finally crossing the Baltic sea to Sweden. Several times you consider stopping but your experiences, the hope held out by Swedenâ€™s generous offer and the knowledge you have family there keeps you going.</p><p>When you finally arrive in Stockholm you claim asylum and contact your family.</p>
