<p>The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/51e7ecc56.html">UNHCR has called for 30,000 of the most vulnerable Syrian refugees to be resettled in western countries</a>. The 30,000 will be selected in a screening process taking place in camps across the region. The odds are slim - 98.5% of the Syrians who have fled the fighting will be left behind. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/fortress-europe-syrian-refugee-shame-exposed-2013-12-11">Eighteen EU countries, including the UK and Italy, have refused to take part</a> - a move that has been condemned by refugee groups. Only the most vulnerable groups, including orphaned children or women at risk of violence are being resettled. You donâ€™t qualify for the scheme. </p>
