<p>There is bad news. You can’t fly to Sweden because you don’t have a visa. There is no such thing as a visa specifically for asylum seekers, you would have to apply to study or visit as a tourist and then apply once you arrived in northern Europe. These visas are almost impossible to get and there are no longer functioning embassies for most EU countries in Damascus where you could apply.</p>

<p>There are now almost no legal ways for Syrians to reach Europe apart from the UNHCR resettlement scheme.  You would need to make it to a refugee camp to apply to be part of it.</p>
