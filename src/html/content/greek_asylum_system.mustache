<p>You join a queue of hundreds of others waiting outside the Aliens Police Directorate in Athens to register as an asylum seeker. Unfortunately the Greek asylum system has been in a state of chaos for several years and your claim for asylum - like the majority of others - is refused. <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/greece-the-end-of-the-road-for-refugees-asylum-seekers-and-migrants">In 2012 no Syrians were given asylum in Greece</a>. There is a backlog of 30,000 unprocessed claims sitting with the Greek authorities. The Greek government has been criticised many times, both by human rights organisations and the European courts for <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=4998&cat=press-release">failing to provide adequate reception and support for asylum seekers</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, you do now have a number of choices. You could return to Turkey and try to reach Europe via Bulgaria instead. You could try to make a life in Athens, blending into the underground Syrian community there. You could use your remaining savings to look for fake passports that would get you onto a plane to Stockholm. Or, if you do not want to risk using a false passport, you could push on toward Sweden by first taking a ferry to Italy.</p>
