    You are given a place to stay in a hostel for families, put in touch with Syrian support groups and given access to a basic benefit that will help you survive until your asylum claim is heard. You explain to the officials why you left Syria and within a month you are told you have permanent residence. You are given social housing and free Swedish lessons and told that once you speak reasonable Swedish you will be given help finding a job. VIDEO INSERT – back to Somalia guy who was resettled, talking about life in Sweden? Although there is now a Common EU Asylum System, which came into operation in summer 2014, nobody denies that the way refugees are treated varies wildly from country to country. In the UK, Sweden and Germany, asylum seekers are given housing while their claim is processed, and support once they are granted refugee status. This is not always the case in Greece, Italy or the eastern European countries. Experts and EU politicians continually warn that as long as these differences exist, people will continue to make dangerous journeys overland to reach a country that promises safety and support.
