<p>Thousands of asylum seekers are detained in Greece (?) each year and held in what have been described as \'appalling conditions\' by the EU home affairs commissioner (name? link?). These periods of detention can last for up to 18 months for administrative purposes only.</p> 

<p>Greece has focused on reinforcing its external borders and started a policy which relies heavily on detention.
