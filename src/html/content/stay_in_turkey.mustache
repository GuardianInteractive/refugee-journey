    You canâ€™t work but you are not under attack so you have a sense of safety. The camp you are in is not a bad one and the Turkish government is doing what it can to provide an education for your children and they are able to go to school for a few hours a day.</p>

<p>You meet your neighbours and eventually start to feel at home in the camp. One of them has a Palestinian grandfather who knows people from his childhood who went to a refugee camp in Lebanon in 1948 and are still there. You wonder if your children will spend their entire lives in this camp. Your story is not over, but nor is it continuing. You stay in Turkey and hope that the peace talks succeed and you can return to Syria soon.</p>


<p>It is estimated (by who?) that there could be a million Syrians living in Turkey by the end of 2014. The UNHCR and other aid organisations have warned of the pressure this is putting on Turkey and also on neighbouring Jordan and Lebanon.</p>
