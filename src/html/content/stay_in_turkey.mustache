<p>You canâ€™t work legally, but you are not under attack. If you stay in a camp, the Turkish government will do what it can to provide an education for your children and they are able to go to school for a few hours a day. You can leave the camp at any time.</p>

<p>You have the support and friendship of a large Syrian community, either in the camp or in cities such as Istanbul if you choose to move there and work under the radar. Officially there are now nearly 600,000 Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as refugees from Iran, Iraq and Turkey.</p>
