<p>You canâ€™t work, but you are not under attack. The Turkish government is doing what it can to provide an education for your children and they are able to go to school for a few hours a day.</p>

<p>You have the support and friendship of a large Syrian community, both in the camp and also in cities like Istanbul if you choose to move there and work under the radar. Officially there are now nearly 600,000 Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as refugees from Iran, Iraq and Turkey.</p>

<p>One of your friends in Turkey has a Palestinian grandfather who has been living in the same camp in Lebanon since 1948. You hope that Syria will be peaceful one day so you can go home - but live with a daily dread that you and your children will live the rest of your lives in limbo.</p>
