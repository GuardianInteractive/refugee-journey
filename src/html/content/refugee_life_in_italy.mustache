    You tell the border officials in Bari that you want to claim asylum. They give you a cash payment of 200 euros and train tickets to Rome. Once you are in Rome you claim asylum. Because you have children you are given a place in a reception centre, although friends you have made on your journey are not so lucky. Not all asylum seekers are given housing in Italy, many end up sleeping on the street.There have been widely reported criticisms of the Italian asylum system and the lack of support for refugees.Asylum seekers say that the huge difference in the way refugees are treated across Europe leaves them with the choice of life on the streets in Greece or Italy, or a hazardous illegal journey towards northern European countries like Sweden, the UK or Germany.VIDEO INSERT – ROME/ CALAIS etc?GO TO VIDEO INSERT> Africans/ Afghans. Eventually you are given refugee status, but there is no welfare support and you can’t speak Italian so it’s impossible to find work. You are allowed to stay in your hostel but you don’t have any money left so you have to rely on church groups for food and basic Italian lessons. Unfortunately you can’t move on now. You have been fingerprinted in Rome and your prints are stored on the Eurodac system. Under the ‘Dublin’ system, asylum seekers are only allowed to make a claim in the first EU country they enter. But the differences in support on offer around the EU means that people continue to try and breach this system. In the two years to the end of October 2013, Sweden has received 20,490 new Syrian asylum applications and Germany received 16,100 such applications. Less than 1,000 people have claimed asylum in each of Greece, Italy and Cyprus. All you can do is struggle on, trying to learn Italian and relying on the support of the churches and fellow refugees.
