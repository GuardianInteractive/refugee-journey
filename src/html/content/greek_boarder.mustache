    You decide that however dangerous the journey across the Greek border might be might be, it’s better than staying in a camp indefinitely. If you make it to northern Europe you are pretty much guarunteed a life in which you can work and move on with your life until it is safe to return to Syria. You leave the camp and take your children to Istanbul, which is full of migrants from across the Middle East and Asia, as well as people smugglers who offer, for a price, to take you across the Greek border.Unfortunately you do not make it across the Greek border. For the past decade this has been the main route for migrants crossing irregularly into the European Union. Over 90 per cent of migrants entered the EU in this way in 2012.But since 2010 there has been a huge increase on EU support for border protection in the Evros region where most migrants cross. (stat here about numbers dropping). In 2012, 8,000 Syrians were arrested on the Greek border. You are stopped by border guards who are abusive to you and your children They take you back in Turkey without assessing whether you are in need of refugee protection even though this is a breach of international law.XXXX VIDEO INSERT (John D has interview with woman who was detained on the Greek border with her daughter, in a van for 11 hours with no water then dumped back into Turkey)A recent report detailed evidence of an illegal ’push back’ policy on both the land and sea border between Turkey and Greece.

You now have two choices.
