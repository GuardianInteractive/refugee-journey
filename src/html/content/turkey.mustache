<p>You walk across the Turkish border and are met by UNHCR officials who take you to a refugee camp and register you.</p>

<p>You are now among around 600,000 Syrians registered as refugees in Turkey. Turkey has an opt out from the Geneva Convention and does not grant asylum to people from outside the European Union. So although you are given support in the camp you will never have the right to work here. Other refugees around you are talking about making the dangerous journey overland into the EU, to join family members and try and get international protection, which carries with it the right to work and live a normal life.(video insert from Turkey?)<p>
