<p>You walk across the Turkish border and are met by UNHCR officials who take you to a refugee camp for registration. You are now among around 600,000 Syrians registered as refugees in Turkey</p>

<p>Turkey has an opt out from the Geneva conventions and does not grant asylum to people from outside the EU. So although you are given support in the camp you will never have the right to work in Turkey. Other refugees around you are talking about making the dangerous journey overland into the EU to join family members and try to get international protection, which carries with it the right to work and live a normal life.(video insert from Turkey?)<p>
